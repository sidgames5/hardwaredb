A database of PC hardware

This repository is part of a larger project which is supposed to be a tool similar to [pc part picker](https://pcpartpicker.com).

## contributing

If you would like to contribute, please get the specifications for every part in your DESKTOP pc from the manufacturer. Add the parts to the files and make sure that your part isn't already there.
